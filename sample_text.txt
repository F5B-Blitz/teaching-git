Hello,
My name is Fritz. I'm forteen and I life in Germany. My hobbies are going to discos, sometimes I hear music on the radio. In the summer I go bathing in a lake. I don't have any brothers or sisters. We take the bus to school. I am in year 9 at my school. My birthday is on Friday. I hope I will receive a new guitar.
When I am grown up I want to be a scientist.

Yours,
Fritz
