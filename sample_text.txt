Hello,

My name is Fritz. I'm fourteen and I live in Germany. My hobbys are go to discos, sometimes I hear music in the radio. In the summer I go bathing in a lake. I haven't any brothers or sisters. We take busses to scool. I visit year 9 at my school. My birthday is on Friday. I hope I will become a new guitar.
When I am grovn up I want to be a sicentist.

Yours,
Fritz Cola
